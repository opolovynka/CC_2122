#  CI (Continuous Integration)
Continuous Integration is conception which allows us to check are all pieces of code integrated to each other. For this purpose we can use different systems. Let's try and analyze some of them.

## Travis
To configurate Travis we have to SignUp with our GitHub account and configurate some access. Let's do it one by one.
* go to [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com);
* SIGN UP WITH GITHUB ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91627367/145447054-c710ff22-0184-486f-ab58-419fa6f1c04d.png) or Sign In if you already have account.
* enter login and password
* enter confirmation code, which you'll recive by email
* then we have to give travis acces to our repository ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91627367/145447564-8e25a39c-0007-4c8c-a6c2-5ab233acfc4d.png)
* I had problems with my email confirmation, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91627367/145447877-54974778-9fd7-4f42-a805-890f529f125c.png)
because I haven't recieve the email to confirm my email and couldn't finish configuration of Travis, but after few days, I've recieved this email, and finally could make it works
