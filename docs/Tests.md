# Tests

***

First of all we had to decided which Framework to use for our tests. Based on this article [NUnit vs. XUnit vs. MSTest: Comparing Unit Testing Frameworks In C#](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/nunit-vs-xunit-vs-mstest/) desision was made that selected Framework will be XUnit because: 
 * It provides the best isolation level of tests
 * Introduction of the [Theory] attribute for parameterized tests is one of the prime examples of the extensibility of the framework. This also makes the implementation of custom functionality much easier
